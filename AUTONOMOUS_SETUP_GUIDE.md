## 🎨 Customization

```

Edit `/src/lib/chatbot.ts`:

```typescript
// Add custom knowledge base entries
knowledgeBase: {
  'custom_topic': 'Your custom response here',
  // ... more entries
}
```

### Customize Branding

Edit `/src/templates/business-templates.ts`:

```typescript
brandColors: {
  primary: '#YOUR_COLOR',
  secondary: '#YOUR_COLOR',
  accent: '#YOUR_COLOR',
}
```

### Add Custom Features

---

## 🤖 Chatbot Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The chatbot automatically configures based on your business type. No coding required!

### Advanced Configuration

#### Custom Greetings

Edit template in `/src/lib/chatbot.ts`:

```typescript
greeting: "Your custom greeting message"
```

#### Quick Replies

```typescript
quickReplies: [
  'Custom reply 1',
  'Custom reply 2',
  'Custom reply 3',
]
```

#### Knowledge Base

```typescript
knowledgeBase: {
  'keyword': 'Response when keyword detected',
  'pricing': 'Custom pricing information',

}
```

### OpenAI Integration

With OpenAI API key configured, the chatbot:
- Understands context from previous messages
- Provides more natural responses
- Learns from conversation patterns
- Handles complex queries better

Without API key, the chatbot:
- Uses rule-based responses
- Matches keywords to knowledge base
- Still captures leads effectively
- Works reliably for common questions
