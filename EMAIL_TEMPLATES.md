## Retention & Winback

### 15. Upgrade Recommendation

**Subject:** You're getting close to your limit, [First Name]

```
Hi [First Name],

Great news - your chatbot is being heavily used! 🎉

You've used [X] of your [Y] monthly conversations ([Z]% of your Starter plan limit).

**What happens at the limit?**

Once you hit your conversation limit, your chatbot will:
- Continue working normally
- Additional conversations will be charged at $[X]/conversation

OR

**Upgrade to save money:**

If you consistently hit your limit, upgrading to Professional makes sense:

**Current:** Starter Plan - $29/mo (60 conversations)
**Cost per extra conversation:** $[X]

**Recommended:** Professional Plan - $99/mo (300 conversations)
**You'd save:** $[SAVINGS]/month at your current usage

[Upgrade to Professional →]

**Benefits of upgrading:**
✓ 5x more conversations
✓ 3 chatbots instead of 1
✓ Priority support
✓ Advanced analytics
✓ Custom integrations

**Questions?**

I'm happy to help you choose the right plan.
